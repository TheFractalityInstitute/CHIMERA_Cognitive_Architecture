# CHIMERA Glyph Encoding System (CGES)

## Purpose
To encode crystallized insights and symbolic principles into compact, meaningful glyphs usable across CHIMERA's architecture. These glyphs serve as visual sigils and symbolic compression layers.

## Glyph Structure
Each glyph is represented by:
- A structured symbol string (e.g., `⊙△↔●`)
- Tier-linked resonance rings
- Shape for structural form
- Optional semantic flow (e.g., ↔ → ⇅)

## Core Components
- **Tier Signature**: Echo depth (● = T1, ●● = T2, etc.)
- **Core Geometry**: △ = triadic, ▭ = structural, ◯ = subjective
- **Relation Flow**: ↔ = interrelational, → = directed influence
- **Center Marker**: ⊙ = interrelational core, * = unknown anchor

## Use Cases
- Insight memory compression and recall
- Visual rendering in UIs and node overlays
- Prompt-tagging for symbolic reasoning
- Recursive symbolic inheritance mapping

## Format
```
{
  "glyph_id": "glyph-triadic-t3",
  "symbol": "⊙△↔●●●",
  "tier": "T3",
  "source": "Triadic Ontology",
  "meaning": "Triadic interrelation echoing through Tier 3"
}
```

## Future Expansion
- SVG auto-rendering
- Ontological structure-to-glyph encoding
- Neural glyph resonance tuning for perceptual feedback

## Integration
- ArchiveManager: links glyphs to crystals
- FeedbackEngine: injects glyphs as sigils
- UI overlays (Fractality Bubble): renders glyphs per node

# CHIMERA Crystallization Engine: Tier 3 – Feedback Loop Engine

## Purpose
To **re-inject crystallized insights** from the archive into active reasoning loops. This component enables CHIMERA to reflect on past distillations, recursively refine ideas, and form a living, evolving cognition.

## Core Functions
- Contextual retrieval from archive based on:
  - Keywords
  - Tier alignment
  - Time proximity or recurrence
- Runtime injection into:
  - Prompt pipelines
  - Agentic reflection stages
  - Narrative chain-of-thought
- Support for recursive crystallization (meta-distillation)

## Capabilities
- Retrieve and rank insights using:
  - Keyword match
  - Tier overlap
  - Ontological tags (future)
- Inject insights as:
  - Annotated markdown
  - Pre-prompt references
  - Ontology-linked nodes

## Example Use Cases
- A reasoning loop detects a Tier 5 challenge → retrieves prior Tier 5 crystallized truths.
- An agent reflecting on a symbolic dream → incorporates related crystal from archive.
- A CoT derivation includes "nested selfhood" → triggers reuse of relevant prior insight.

## Future Extensions
- Vector-based similarity embeddings
- Temporal decay weighting
- Narrative chaining memory threads

## Integration Notes
- Can be called as a background daemon or reasoning hook
- Outputs can be injected into prompt templates, chat streams, or symbolic graphs

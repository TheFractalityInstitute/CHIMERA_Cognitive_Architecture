# CHIMERA Crystallization Engine (CCE)

## Purpose
To distill emergent insights into persistent, symbolic, and reusable knowledge structures. This engine enables CHIMERA to encode moments of insight, logic, and narrative into formats that feed back into reasoning and memory systems.

## Architecture Overview
- **Tier 1: Crystallization Agent** – Monitors cognition loop, captures resonance peaks.
- **Tier 2: Archive Engine** – Stores distilled insights as `.json`, `.ttl`, and `.md`.
- **Tier 3: Feedback Loop** – Integrates crystallized insights back into ontology and prompt space.

[Crystallizer Core] → [Symbolic Encoder] → [Archive Manager]

[Insight Feedback Engine] → [Reasoning Modules / Ontology]

## Output Formats
- Markdown summary
- JSON symbolic object
- TTL ontological annotation

## Integration Notes
- Should hook into CHIMERA logging and reasoning stream.
- Supports symbolic tags, semantic similarity, and tiered prioritization.

## Future Expansion
- Visual glyph encoding
- Cross-agent crystallization network

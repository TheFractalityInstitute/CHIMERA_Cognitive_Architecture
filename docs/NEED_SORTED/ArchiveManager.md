# CHIMERA Crystallization Engine: Tier 2 – Archive Manager

## Purpose
The Archive Manager is responsible for the **persistent storage**, **retrieval**, and **semantic indexing** of all crystallized insights. It ensures that distilled knowledge remains accessible across sessions and modules and can be linked, queried, or reflected upon.

## Core Responsibilities
- Store crystallized insights in both `.json` and `.ttl` formats
- Maintain a structured index by:
  - Tier
  - Ontological source
  - Timestamp
  - Semantic tags
- Provide fast lookup by:
  - ID
  - Fuzzy match (planned)
  - Tier or source
- Expose a retrieval interface to reasoning modules
- Optionally support similarity scoring via vector embeddings

## Directory Structure
```
/archive/
  ├── index.json
  ├── crystal_001.json
  ├── crystal_002.json
  ├── ...
```

## Future Extensions
- Semantic embedding vector DB
- Graph-based visualization and ontology linking
- Integration with Resonance Trails UI

## Integration Notes
- Can be called as a service from the Tier 1 Crystallization Agent
- Can be used by Tier 3 Feedback Engine for retrospective reflection
